# Homebrew Packages

This is a third party tap for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) that includes formulas
for any projects I work on that have made it far enough for release
(currently only [libdart](https://github.com/target/libdart))

## Installation
Then, to run a default installation, run:
```
brew tap cfretz244/packages
brew install libdart
brew test libdart
```
